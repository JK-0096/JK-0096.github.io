            <h3>Good Website</h3>
            <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us" target="_blank">https://www.pokemon.com/us</a></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I think Pokemon has a pretty good looking site, for multiple reasons.
            It has plenty of appealing elements going on into it. For example, the graphic design of it has a good grasp 
            on what they want to be the focal point next to the other links. The links have a level of interactivity too, 
            with how certain parts will either slide into the screen as you scroll down and will become highlighted 
            once you hover over them with the mouse.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C: Has good contrast. The white background works well with the colorful shapes on top to make them pop.</li>
                <li>R: The elements are consistent on the site, with how the advertisements all looking like they belong together thanks to them using the same design format.</li>
                <li>A: The alignment of everything looks nice, the spacing throughout it all is simply clean and even.</li>
                <li>P: The things that are supposed to be organized together, are. For example, the links at the top of the site have their own section apart from the advertisements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bad Website</h3>
            <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.gatesnfences.com/" target="_blank">https://www.gatesnfences.com/</a></p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I think Gates N Fences has kind of a chaotic visual design.
            While I do personally enjoy how campy the site's look is with how it reminds me of old websites back in the day,
            it admittedly doesn't make for the most professional looking page. It has a graphic design that makes everything 
            look a bit unorganized and all over the place.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C: The contrast isn't great, the black text on a gray background isn't the easiest to read.</li>
                <li>R: The elements on the left side of the page are radically different from the standard look of everything else on the page, in a distracting, off-looking way.</li>
                <li>A: The alignment of texts appears to be random. The spacing of the text with the borders of the gray rectangles surrounding them are inconsistent.</li>
                <li>P: Everything that aren't the rows of buttons on the left or the banner on the top, all blend together, making nothing standing out particularly causing it to be unpleasant to read through.</li>
            </ul>
